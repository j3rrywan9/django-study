# marshmallow

marshmallow is an ORM/ODM/framework-agnostic library for converting complex datatypes, such as objects, to and from native Python datatypes.

In short, marshmallow schemas can be used to:
* **Validate** input data.
* **Deserialize** input data to app-level objects.
* **Serialize** app-level objects to primitive Python types.
The serialized objects can then be rendered to standard formats such as JSON for use in an HTTP API.
